# Spammers Suck
## Let's waste their precious time

I was sick and tired of receiving un-solicited spam emails from tech companies in India, head-hunters, and Nigerian princes. 

Marking an email as "spam" in Gmail just doesn't feel like justice is being served.

So, I decided to create the sp@mlooper.


# How does it work?
1. Forward a spammy email to sp@mlooper.com
2. We assign John Turing, or one of our other trusty loopers, to the email
3. John Turing then pretends like _he_ received the email and loops the spammer in an endless back-and-forth of questions
4. You kick back, have a brewski, and enjoy the fact that the spammer is getting crushed

# Why are you doing this?
My inbox is a sacred place and spammers are taking a giant dump on it. I needed a way to combat the problem and laugh at the ridiculousness of it. 

# How much does this cost?
It's free

# How do I sign up?
You don't. You just forward a spam email to sp@mlooper.com â€” that's it.

# Are you afraid spammers will find out about this?
Yeah, that's definitely a problem. I was thinking that I could purchase other domain names, not list them here, and respond from those. If you have some other ideas, shoot me an email at sp@mlooper.com... kidding, send it to be.winston@gmail.com

Spammers waste time responding to fake bots, rather than sending out more spammy emails.
